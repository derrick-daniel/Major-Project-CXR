# Major Project CXR - Experimentation Hub

Welcome to my experimental playground for my major project on Chest X-Ray (CXR) analysis! This repository is where I tinker with different machine learning models, methods, and ideas—nothing too serious, just pure exploration and learning.

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project is all about exploring various approaches to analyzing chest X-ray images. Whether it's trying out new algorithms, tweaking existing models, or just messing around with code, the goal is to learn and have fun.

## 🤖 What's Inside
- **Different Models**: Experimenting with various machine learning and deep learning models.
- **Method Testing**: Testing different methods for image processing and analysis.
- **Results & Observations**: Insights and observations from various experiments.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- PyTorch
- TorchVision
- Scikit-learn
- And any tool that seems interesting!
